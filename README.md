# PyPlusPLus
It's like Python and C++ had an ugly baby.
All the funky functionality with none of the elegance.

## Symbol Table
The Symbol Table is implemented using a custom Hash Table. Collisions are solved using separate chaining.
Internally, itâ€™s represented as an array of linked list nodes, where the key of a node is its position in the array and its value is the given symbol.

### Class attributes
- capacity -> the maximum capacity of the symbol table (default = 100)
- size -> the current size of the symbol table
- buckets -> the internal array of linked list nodes

### Operations
- add(value) -> adds a new node that has a given value
- find(value) -> finds the index of the node that has a given value
- remove(value) -> removes the node that has a given value
- size() -> returns the number of elements in the symbol table
- export() -> exports the contents of the symbol table to a file st.out

## Program Information File
The Program Information File (abbreviated as PIF from now on) is implemented using a simple array.

### Class attributes
- array -> the internal array of PIF entries

### Operations
- add(code, position) -> adds a new entry to the PIF
- export() -> exports the contents of the PIF to a file pif.out

## Scanner
The Scanner is implemented.

### Regex
The following regexes are used to match the tokens:
- identifier: `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$`
- constant: `^\"[A-Za-z0-9\.\?\!, ]*\"$` (strings) and `^-?[1-9][0-9]*$` (integers)

## Finite Automata
The finite automata parser is implemented using arrays and objects. It is used to match the following tokens:
- integer constants (fa_id.in)
- identifiers (fa_id.in)

### Class attributes
- states -> the number of states in the finite automata
- alphabet -> the alphabet of the finite automata
- transitions -> the transition function of the finite automata
- initial_state -> the initial state of the finite automata
- final_states -> the final states of the finite automata
- err -> error string used to signal that the finite automata is in an invalid state

### Operations
- read(filename) -> reads the finite automata from a file
- validate() -> validates the finite automata
- is_deterministic() -> checks if the finite automata is deterministic
- is_accepted(sequence) -> checks if a given sequence is accepted by the finite automata
- getters for the class attributes

### Structure
The finite automata is read from an input file with the following structure:
```
file = states '\n' alphabet '\n' initial_state '\n' final_states '\n' transitions
states = state {' ' state}
alphabet = symbol {' ' symbol}
initial_state = state
final_state = state {' ' state}
transitions = transition {'\n' transition}
transition = state ' ' symbol ' ' state
state = letter {digit}
symbol = letter | digit | special
letter = 'a' | 'b' | ... | 'z' | 'A' | 'B' | ... | 'Z'
digit = '0' | '1' | ... | '9'
special = '+' | '-' | '_' | ...  
```

## Grammar
The grammar used for the parser is implemented using arrays and objects. 

### Class attributes
- non_terminals -> the non-terminals of the grammar
- terminals -> the terminals of the grammar
- productions -> the productions of the grammar
- start_symbol -> the start symbol of the grammar

### Operations
- read(filename) -> reads the grammar from a file
- is_CFG() -> checks if the grammar is context free
- getters for the class attributes
- get_productions_for_nonterminals(nonterminal) -> returns the productions for a given non-terminal
- export()

## Parser
The parser implements the functionality of a Recursive Descendent parsing algorithm using a table to represent the Parsing Tree.

### Class Atrributes
- grammar -> the grammar used
- word -> the sequence to parse
- config -> the configuration used

The Configuration class represents the stacks and members used by the parser, along with methods to use said stacks and members
- stack -> the work stack
- input -> the input stack
- current_state -> the current state of the parser
- current_position -> the current position in the work stack

### Operations
- momentary_insuccess -> sets the state to a backtracking state
- success -> sets the state to a successful state
- advance -> parses through one character in the work stack
- back -> goes back a character that was parsed
- expand -> expands the used grammar to continue parsing
- another_try -> goes back and uses another approach to advance by expanding
